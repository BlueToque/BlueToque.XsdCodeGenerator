# BlueToque XSD Code Generator
This project is a Visual Studio Extension that generates code from an XML 
Schema Document

The tool does something very similar to the xsd.exe tool that shipped with 
Visual Studio in the early days. The tool consumes an XML Schema Document 
(XSD), validates it, and generates code. Each ComplexType in the XSD 
becomes a class in the code generator. 

The code is modified using uptional CodeModifiers. These can do utility 
tasks like convert arrays (generated by default) to collections, add 
certain attributes to all classes, and manipulate the imports and types 
generates so multiple XSD code generators can co-exist.
